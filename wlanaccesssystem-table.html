		The cryptographic key derivation algorithm required by IEEE 802.11-2020 (Section
		12.7.1.2) and verified in WPA2 certification is PRF-384, which uses the HMAC-SHA-1 function and
		outputs 384 bits.
		The use of GCMP is defined in IEEE 802.11ax-2021 (Section 12.5.5) and
		requires a
		Key Derivation Function (KDF) based on HMAC-SHA-256 (for 128-bit symmetric keys) or HMAC-SHA-384 (for 256-bit symmetric keys).
		This KDF outputs 704 bits.
	      </p>
	      <p>
		This requirement applies only to the keys that are generated or derived for the communications
		between the AP and the client once the client has been authenticated.
		It refers to the derivation of the Group Temporal Key (GTK),
		through the Random Bit Generator (RBG) specified in this PP-Module,
		as well as the derivation of the Pairwise Transient Key (PTK) from the Pairwise Master Key (PMK),
		which is done using a random value generated by the RBG specified in this PP-Module,

                are used by the TOE in establishing and maintaining secure connectivity to the wireless clients. This

                description of the developer’s methods of assuring that their implementation conforms to the
                cryptographic standards; this includes not only testing done by the developing organization, but also
                proof of third-party testing that is performed (e.g. WPA2 certification). The evaluator will ensure that

		  The evaluator will perform the following test using a packet sniffing tool to collect
		  frames between the TOE and a wireless client:
		<p>
                  Step 1: The evaluator will configure the AP to an unused channel and configure the WLAN
                  sniffer to sniff only on that channel (i.e., lock the sniffer on the selected channel).
		  The sniffer should also be configured to filter on the MAC address of the TOE and client.
		</p>
		<p>
                  Step 2: The evaluator will configure the TOE to communicate with a WLAN client using IEEE 
                  802.11-2020 and a 256-bit (64 hex values 0-f) pre-shared key,
		  setting up the connections as described in the operational guidance.
		  The pre-shared key is only used for testing.
		</p>
		<p>
                  Step 3: The evaluator will start the sniffing tool, initiate a connection between the
		  TOE and WLAN client, and allow the TOE to authenticate, associate, and successfully
		  complete the four-way handshake with the client.
		</p>
		<p>
                  Step 4: The evaluator will set a timer for one minute, at the end of which the evaluator
		  will disconnect the client from the TOE and stop the sniffer.
		</p>
		<p>
                  Step 5: The evaluator will identify the four-way handshake frames (denoted EAPOL-key in Wireshark
                  captures) and derive the PTK from the four-way handshake frames and pre-shared key as specified
		  in IEEE 802.11-2020.
		</p>
		<p>
                  Step 6: The evaluator will select the first data frame from the captured packets that was
		  sent between the client and TOE after the four-way handshake successfully completed
		  and without the frame control value 0x4208 (the first two bytes are 08 42).
		  The evaluator will use the PTK to decrypt the data portion of the packet as specified in
		  IEEE 802.11-2020 and verify that the decrypted data contains ASCII-readable text.

		<p>
                  Step 7: The evaluator will repeat Step 6 for the next two data frames between the TOE and client,

            This requirement covers the TOE's role as the authenticator in an 802.1X
            authentication exchange. If the exchange is completed successfully, the TOE will obtain the PMK from
            the RADIUS server and perform the four-way handshake with the wireless client (supplicant) to begin
            802.11 communications.</p>
	    <p>
            As indicated previously, there are at least three communication paths present during the exchange; two
            with the TOE as an endpoint and one with the TOE acting as a transfer point only.
	    The TOE establishes an EAP over Local Area Network (EAPOL) connection with the wireless
	    client as specified in 802.1X-2007.
	    The TOE also establishes (or has established) a RADIUS protocol connection protected either
	    by IPsec or RadSec (TLS) with the RADIUS server. 
            The wireless client and RADIUS server establish an EAP-TLS session
            (RFC 5216); in this transaction the TOE merely takes the EAP-TLS packets from its EAPOL/RADIUS
            endpoint and transfers them to the other endpoint. Because the specific authentication method (TLS in
            this case) is opaque to the TOE, there are no requirements with respect to RFC 5126 in this PP-Module.
            However, the base RADIUS protocol (2865) has an update (3579) that will need to be addressed in the
            implementation and evaluation activities. Additionally, RFC 5080 contains implementation issues that
            will need to be addressed by developers but which levy no new requirements.</p>
	    <p>
            
            The point of performing 802.1X authentication is to provide access to the network (assuming the
            authentication was successful and that all 802.11 negotiations are performed successfully); in the
            terminology of 802.1X, this means the wireless client has access to the "controlled port" maintained by
            the TOE.

                In order to show that the TSF implements the 802.1X-2010 standard correctly, the evaluator will ensure
                that the TSS contains the following information: <ul>
                <li>The sections (clauses) of the standard that the TOE implements</li>
                <li>For each identified section, any options selected in the implementation allowed by the
                standards are specified</li>
                <li>For each identified section, any non-conformance is identified and described, including a
                justification for the non-conformance</li>
                </ul>
                Because the connection to the RADIUS server will be contained in an IPsec or RadSec (TLS) tunnel,
                the security mechanisms detailed in the RFCs identified in the requirement are not relied on to provide
                protection for these communications. Consequently, no extensive analysis of the RFCs is required.
                However, the evaluator will ensure that the TSS describes the measures (documentation, testing) that
                are taken by the product developer to ensure that the TOE conforms to the RFCs listed in this
                requirement.<br/><br/>
              
              There are no guidance evaluation activities for this component.<br/><br/>

                The test is actually that a failed authentication (under two failure modes) results in denial of access to
                the network, which demonstrates the enforcement of FIA_8021X_EXT.1.3.
